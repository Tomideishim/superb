 <ol>
    <li>Four arms</li>
    <img src="images/Four arms.png" alt="Four arms">
    <p>Description: Four Arms is described as a red humanoid alien that is approximately 12 feet tall. 
       He has well developed muscles, two pairs of four-fingered arms, has tough looking red skin, a 
       black stripe that goes from his chin to his lower lip, and he has four yellow eyes: a main pair 
       above and a smaller pair below them. Four Arms wears a white T-shirt with a black line going down
       it, black colored pants, and fingerless gloves. He also doesn’t have any hair (just so you know). 
       The Omnitrix symbol is located on his upper left shoulder. When he was used by Ben 10,000 in an 
       alternate dimension, Four Arms appeared to have a better developed forehead, more developed muscle
       mass, a very different T-shirt design, and a pair of jutting incisors. Plus the Omnitrix symbol was
       located on his chest instead of his left shoulder.</p>
            
       <p>Abilities:The first ability of Four Arms is his enhanced strength! With this ability he can be able 
        to lift things that are several times his very own weight and he can punch through any various resilient 
        materials with ease. For example Four Arms can lift anything that’s as heavy as a weapon, from big rocks, 
        which he can throw several feet away, to beams and pillars, which he can use as clubs. His strength can allow 
        him to expand his jaws to bite metal or even damage it. His other three abilities show that he has pretty good
        enhanced reflexes, enhanced speed, and agility. The fourth ability that Four Arms uses is his sonic clap shock
        wave ability. The way that Four Arms demonstrates this ability is by creating powerful strong shock waves can 
        be demonstrated by clapping all four of his hands together or by slamming all four of his fists on the ground 
        pretty hard. Four Arms third ability is his enhanced jumping ability. This kind of ability can allow him to 
        jump at least several times his own height, which is seven stories up in a single bound to be exact. Four 
        Arms fourth ability is the high durability he has. This ability makes him almost fire proof, laser-proof, 
        and being able to survive a fall if he fell from something that is pretty high above the ground.</p>
    <li>Heatblast</li>
    <img src="images/Heatblast.png" alt="Heatblast">
    <p>Description: Heatblast can be described as a magma-based life form whose body is composed of a 
       bright inner magma is covered by dark red or brown lava rocks. Since he is a fire-based entity, Heatblast’s entire
       body can radiate high amounts of heat which means that you have better be careful of that. His feet can be described
       as a slight oval-like design with only two toes and one back toe. 4 year old Heatblast does look the same as the older
       Heatblast except he has a much thinner body, an oversized head, and a much higher pitched voice. Also the Omnitrix symbole
       is loacted on his chest.</p>
    <p>Heatblasts first ability is that he can be able to generate and manipulate intense heat and fire from his body. He can form 
       fire into any shape that he chooses. His second ability shows that he can enhance the fire in his hands for flaming punches.
       Heatblast third ability shows that he can breathe fire. Heatblast’s fourth ability showed that with his fire can become hot 
       enough that it could melt a tank in Viktor: The “Spoils”, and melt a road, almost burying Vilgax in boiling tar in Secrets,
       and once even burying Vilgax in the ground up to his shoulders in Secrets. Heatblast’s fifth ability was shown in the episode
       Don’t Drink the Water. In that episode it is shown that when 4-year-old Heatblast gets a temper tantrum, his firepower is magnified
       to the point where its called “supernova-hot” and this kind heat was so extreme that is able to flash vaporized the Fountain of Youth
       water for example, plus a large portion of a cave. Heatblast’s sixth ability is that he can also make his flames very explosive, which
       explains why his fire is tended to blow things up on a regular basis. Heatblast’s seventh ability shows that he can even manipulate his
       fire to create a fire board on which he can use to ride at high speeds by launching fire backwards like an engine or a rocket. On this 
       fire board that he creates, Heatblast has enough skill to ride in a continuous circle, as shown in the episode “Monster Weather”. He can
       even use the fire to jet propel himself like a rocket. Heatblast’s eighth ability is shown that he’s fireproof, as well as heat resistant
       and being invulnerable to magma. Interestingly, it is shown that he is also cold resistant and ice proof. Heatblast’s ninth shows that he’s
       capable of using an ability called terrakinesis. With this he can channeling fire through the ground and the result of this capability is 
       the ability to surf through the air on a board made out of rock. Heatblast’s other abilities are enhanced strength and durability. This 
       enhanced strength is helpful enough to help him hold his own with his fists against Viktor which made the latter 
       stumble several steps backwards. The durability was shown in the episode The Beginning of the End when Heatblast 
       went through the rock ceiling of a cave and he came out with fine with no damage. Heatblast can even swim 
       underwater and use his powers underwater, but he can only use them at a very low intensity.</p>   
    <li>Ripjaws</li>
    <img src="images/Ripjaws.jpg" alt="Ripjaws">
    <p>Description: Ripjaws can be described as a walking grey colored fish-like alien that is shown to share some traits with some of the aquatic
       animals we have on earth. These traits that he shares with are alligators, eels, angler fish (the Phosphorescent light located on his head),
       and sharks. You might even be astonished to know that Ripjaws has feet that look very similar to Four Arm’s feet. His eyes are a kind of 
       grayish color. When he talks he speaks in a deep gasping voice. The Omnitrix symbol is located on his upper left torso. </p>
       
    <p>Abilities: Ripjaws first ability that he has is breathing underwater (just like any fish), swimming very fast at high speeds, changing between
       a fish tail or legs at will, and using a phosphorescent light on his head which he can use to help him see in very dark areas (like an angler
       fish does). Since you know that Ripjaws can turn his legs into a tail, this display of distinctive feature gives him a merman-like appearance.
       When Ripjaws is outside his water environment when on land, he’s shown to display a loincloth with a very similar pattern to his tail (implying
       that when the loincloth wraps around his legs the loincloth and legs fuse to become the tail). Even though Ripjaws can breathe underwater like 
       any kind of fish, as well as swimming very fast, his fifth ability shows that he’s known to withstand very strong water pressure with great 
       endurance. This implies that Ripjaws possesses the nature of abyssal aquatic life, hence his blank eyes and the anglerfish light in his 
       forehead, which can serve as a light in dark areas. His sixth and seventh abilities show that he’s even highly agile and dexterous. His 
       eighth ability is his expendable steel-bending jaws which are large enough to hold any supply of objects like the Krakken’s two eggs for
       example as seen in the episodes The Krakken and Gone Fishin’. His ninth and tenth abilities are his claws and sharp teeth, which can be 
       used to shred and even, damage metal. Ripjaws final ability is his enhanced strength, with means that like Four Arms, he can lift any 
       objects that weigh more than his own weight. He did also used his enhanced strenght to punch a hole in a dock in the episode Last Laugh.</p>
    <li>Wildmutt</li>
    <img src="images/wildmutt.png" alt="Wildmutt">
    <p>Description: Wildmutt can be described as a huge, orange dog but he has no eyes, ears, or tail. His posture movements
       are also somewhat apelike. The teeth are very defined and stick out of his mouth so that you can take a good look at them. Though Wildmutt
       has no eyes, he instead using his sense of smell and hearing, which are aided by three gill-like nostrils that are located on each side of
       his neck. The Omnitrix symbol is located on a brace on his left shoulder. Also Four-year-old Wildmutt looks very similar to his ten year 
       old self, but a lot smaller and thinner.</p>
    <p>Abilities:Although we all know that Wildmutt does not have any eyes, one of the abilities that he uses better than eyes is his sense of 
       smell and hearing. Three gill-like nostrils that can be located on each side of his neck aid Wildmutt’s sense of smell ability. Wildmutt’s smelling ability is superb because when he is starts sniffing his “vision” is made up of a dull 3D mapping of where each of these scents originate and like a regular dog he can basically track anything by their scent, regardless if they’re miles away from him. His second ability is enhanced hearing. With this ability Wildmutt’s senses can take the form of either radar or sonar, allowing him to still perceive his environment more clearly. His third ability, enhanced speed and reaction time, allow him to dodge, evade, and counterattack effortlessly with the help of his senses. Wildmutt’s fourth and fifth special abilities are enhanced strength and his teeth, which he can use both to rip off the roof of a car with ease. His fifth special ability is his enhanced agility, which allows him to run, jump, as well as climb at a superhuman rate, which makes him highly acrobatic and gymnastic. Those movements can appear to be very similar to that of an ape. His sharp claws are his sixth ability. With these claws Wildmutt can dig deep craters at a fast pace so make sure to watch out flying dirt and things. His claws can also cut through anything like ropes, nets, etc. Plus watch out when he’s using his claws because they’re sharp. Wildmutt’s final ability is that he’s shown to be a quadruped, but even though he’s capable of standing on his hind legs and can punch, it’s a bit awkward when he stands up to punch a bad guy in the face or stomach.</p>
