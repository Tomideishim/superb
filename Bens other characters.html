    <p>In the original series called "Ben 10", Gwen shares a hate/love friendship with her cousin Ben. 
        Through the entire show, Gwen usually insults Ben just because they share the same birthday. Gwen
        uses her computer to find out any weird or strange people that they may come across, during their 
        adventures. In "Ben 10 Alien Force", she is trained in gymnastics and has a black belt in martial 
        arts.  She also has a crush on Ben's old friend/enemy Kevin Levin. Throughout most of the series,
        Gwen created a persona named  "Lucky Girl." Lucky Girl was mostly what her name said, she used Lu
        ck in her own advantage. She eventually hanged up her mask after getting an artifact destroyed by Ben's alien Fourarms.</p>
